I'm a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the [UCL Genetics Institute](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/departments/gee/research-centres/genetics-institute) in the [Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/departments/gee). My research focus is genomic instability and tumour-immune crosstalk during cancer progression.

I received my bachelor's degree from [Jacobs University](https://www.jacobs-university.de/) (Bremen, Germany) and my PhD from the [European Molecular Biology Laboratory](https://www.embl.de/) (EMBL, Heidelberg) and the University of Heidelberg (Germany).  Following my PhD I worked on the genomics of oesophageal cancer as a Research Associate at the [Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute](https://www.cruk.cam.ac.uk/), and on the identification of new targets and immuno-oncology as a Senior Scientist at [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.co.uk/).

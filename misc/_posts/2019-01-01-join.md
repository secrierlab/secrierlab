*We will be recruiting for a computational postdoc funded by the Wellcome Trust shortly, so watch this space.*

We are always interested in hearing from ambitious, creative and enthusiastic graduate students and postdocs interested in our research, whom we are happy to support with applications for fellowships. We place particular emphasis on cancer genomics, immunology, computational method development, machine learning and data integration.

## Graduate students

Potential graduate students should apply through the [UCL-Birkbeck MRC DTP programme](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mrc-dtp/).

## Postdoctoral fellows

We are keen to provide support for fellowship applications. Please send (1) cover letter that includes a short statement of research interests, (2) a current CV and (3) code samples or links to published/distributed code to m.secrier<span style="display:none">obfuscate</span>@ucl.ac.uk.
